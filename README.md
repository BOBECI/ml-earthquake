## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
In this project, we have used the data of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_2015_Nepal_earthquake">past earthquake</a>
which includes the informations of structures which effected by earthquake. With using this building informations, we will be trying to predict the damage level of a structure. For this purpose, different Machine Learning algorithms will be used to see the difference between them on our dataset.

## üìÉ Dataset <a name = "dataset"></a>

[2015 Nepal Earthquake: Open Data Portal](http://eq2015.npc.gov.np/)

**762094 instances and 43 features**

## :muscle: Additional Work <a name = "more"></a>

- Each week, as we made progress on the project, we wrote a blog post to explain the thing we done. All of them can be seen here :

- Also, at the end of the project, we created a short video to introduce our work :
