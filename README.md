## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>
In this project, we have used the data of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_2015_Nepal_earthquake">past earthquake</a>
which includes the informations of structures which effected by earthquake. With using this building informations, we will be trying to predict the damage level of a structure. For this purpose, different Machine Learning algorithms will be used to see the difference between them on our dataset.
